# DPU-Accelerated-Watermarking-Results
Dataset of visual results showing a 192-bit invisible watermarking system guided by deep saliency maps. Watermarked and post-attack images are included for real-time embedded implementation studies.


This repository contains sample results generated from our saliency (visual attention)-guided stealth digital watermarking study. The repository includes original images, watermarked outputs embedded with 192-bit secret information, examples subjected to attacks such as JPEG, blurring, and scaling, and deep learning-based saliency maps. This data is being shared to support the reproducibility of this publication.

In this study, watermarking was performed using a deep learning-based embedding model and a fully hardware-accelerated inference module. The samples were taken from experiments conducted in both software and embedded platforms. The repository contains only experimental output samples; the model weights, training datasets, and codebase are not yet publicly available.
